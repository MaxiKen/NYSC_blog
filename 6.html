            <p>
              His Excellency, Senator Ademola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke, the
              Executive Governor of Osun State, officially inaugurated the
              National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Orientation Course for the
              2024 Batch A Stream 1 Corps Members today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Represented by the Secretary of the State Governor, Honorable
              Teslim Igbalaye, Governor Adeleke extended heartfelt
              congratulations to the Corps Members embarking on their one-year
              mandatory service in Osun State, as well as those dislodged from
              Lagos for the regimented three-week Orientation Programme.
            </p>
            <p>
              In his address, Governor Adeleke commended the NYSC Scheme for its
              unwavering commitment to fostering national unity and
              understanding among youths from diverse ethnic backgrounds. He
              acknowledged the prevailing economic challenges in the country and
              praised the NYSC for its innovative solutions, citing the program
              as a beacon of hope.
            </p>
            <p>
              Emphasizing the significance of the NYSC program in fostering
              self-discovery and personal growth, Governor Adeleke urged Corps
              Members to fully immerse themselves in every phase of their
              service year, from orientation to completion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Assuring the safety and welfare of Corps Members throughout their
              service year, Governor Adeleke affirmed his administration's
              dedication to supporting and protecting them during their stay in
              the State.
            </p>
            <p>
              Governor Adeleke charged Corps Members to serve as ambassadors of
              unity and make a meaningful impact in their host communities,
              encouraging them to forge valuable relationships beyond
              geographical and ethnic boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earlier, the State Coordinator, Mr Ndoma Obim Agbor, extended a
              warm welcome to Governor Adeleke, the Director General of NYSC,
              Brigadier General YD Ahmed, and other dignitaries present. He
              congratulated the Corps Members and disclosed that a total of 1126
              Corps Members were registered for the service year in Osun State,
              with 1097 undergoing the orientation course after being dislodged
              from Lagos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Addressing the gathering, Mr. Obim underscored the transformative
              role of the NYSC Scheme, describing it as a foundational pillar
              for nurturing youths to contribute positively to society through
              leadership training, cultural exchange, and community service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further emphasizing the solemnity of the National Pledge and NYSC
              Oath of Allegiance, Mr. Obim urged Corps Members to view it not as
              a formality, but as a sacred commitment to service, unity, and
              patriotism.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the swearing-in ceremony presided over by the Chief Judge
              of Osun State, Hon. Justice Oyebola Adepele Ojo and Hon. Justice
              Sikiru Adeposi Òkè, representatives of different platoons signed
              the oath form, symbolizing their commitment to the shared
