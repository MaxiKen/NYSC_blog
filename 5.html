            <p>
              The NYSC Osun State Permanent Orientation Camp, Ede was filled
              with excitement and gratitude today as the Director-General of the
              National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General YD Ahmed,
              paid a momentous visit. His presence brought a surge of energy to
              the camp, especially during the Swearing-in Ceremony of the 2024
              Batch A Stream 1 Corps Members, which he graced with his
              distinguished presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brig Gen YD Ahmed took the opportunity to address the Corps
              Members, commending them for their discipline and dedication. He
              congratulated them wholeheartedly on their Swearing-in ceremony
              and spoke passionately about the core values of the NYSC Scheme,
              emphasizing unity, integrity, and respect among the Corps Members.

              importance of adhering to NYSC guidelines and maintaining
              appropriate dress standards, Brig Gen YD Ahmed instilled a sense
              of responsibility among the Corps Members.

              personal growth. Drawing from his own experience in Osun State
              during his service year, he underscored the profound impact it had
              on his life and career.

              gratitude for the genuine care and commitment shown towards the
              Corps Members. Mr. Obim also commended the Corps Members for their
              discipline, reassuring the Director-General of their readiness to
              serve their fatherland with distinction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Adding to the joyous atmosphere, Brig Gen YD Ahmed made a cheerful
              donation of four cows and eighty cartons of drinks to the Corps
              Members, enhancing the experience for all present. Cash gifts were
              equally presented by the Director Special Duties, Mrs Bona
              Fasakin, on behalf of the Director General, to the three Corps
              Camp Directors, the Parade Commander, Man O'War, Band, Quarter
              Guard, Cultural Dancers.
