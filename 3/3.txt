NYSC OSUN KICKS OFF SAED HANDS ON TRAINING

The 2024 Batch A stream 1 Orientation Course has today kicked off it's Skill Aquisition and Enterprenuership hands on training at the Osun State Permanent Orientation Camp, Ede.

The training which kicked off after series of lectures on the importance of the programme in the past few days  had Corps Members choose their skill of interest. The sequel of lectures that preceded the training  made established that the SAED programme was not optional but compulsory for every Corps Member.

The facilitators of the different skill sets took the corps Members through the rudiments of the respective craft reassuring them of the financial benefit associated with having a skill. 

The commitment of the Osun State NYSC management to the SAED Programme is clearly reflective of its desire to not only breed disciplined Corps Members but employable and financially  independent citizens.

Some of the skill sets available to the Corps Members include catering, phone repair, electrical job, food processing, public speaking etc.
