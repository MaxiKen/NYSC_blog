            <p>
              Platoon 2 has today clinched the first position in the 2024 Batch
              A Stream 1 Interplatoon Drills Competition which held at the NYSC
              Permanent Orientation Camp, Ede.
            </p>
            <p>
              The competition which was sponsored by the Commander Engineering
              Construction Command Nigeria Army, Ede featured a display of
              strength, agility and unity by the Corps Members.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Camp Commandant, Capt. JA Bello, in his address noted that the
              drill competition reflected the highest level of the camp's
              regimented nature. He noted that the competition also fosters
              unity and integration among the Corps Members. It also instills
              discipline, physical and mental alertness in them.
            </p>
            <p>
              He thanked the State Coordinator, Mr Ndoma Obim for providing an
              enabling environment for the competition to hold and the ECC
              Commander for providing the tools needed for the drills.
            </p>
            <p>
              The team of Judges who comprised of four high ranking officers, Lt
              Ogbobi, Lt Ukaibe, Lt Dangiwa, Lt Akinde, assessed the different
              platoons on the basis of their turn out, (dressing and
              Uniformity), word of command, slow march, quick march, open and
              close order, eyes right and eyes left, dressing into line and the
              review order. The judges who proceeded to the parade ground to
              carry out inspection on the platoons left the crowd cheering with
              their beautiful display of order.
            </p>
            <p>
              The event captured intriguing Moments from the different platoons
              who made their display and procession on the parade ground. On the
              command of their guard commander, they brought to life the
              training and discipline they have been subjected to the past few
              days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Platoon 2 with guard commander Chigozie Ebubechukwu Goodness,
              LA/24A/3322 went on to clinche the first position with a total
              point of 70%, leaving Platoon 1 and 4 with the 2nd and 3rd
              position respectively. Platoon 8 however copped the Otondo giant
              spoon coming 10th position.
            </p>
            <p>
              Present at the event was the Commander Engineering Construction
              command Nigerian Army, Ede who was ably represented by Lt. Col VJ
              Ibekwe; the State Coordinator, Mr Ndoma Obim Agbor; the Camp
              Director, Mrs Taiwo Fatimah; and other distinguished camp
              officials.
            </p>
            <p>
              The event ended in a jubilation mood as Corps Members celebrated
              with their Platoons capturing on photograph the victorious
              moments.
